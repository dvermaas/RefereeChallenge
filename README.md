# Referee Challenge

UvA batchelor thesis project, which aims to resolve ["The Visual Referee Challenge"](https://spl.robocup.org/wp-content/uploads/SPL-Rules-2022.pdf#page=51). 
This solution to the challenge aims to combine whistle detection and pose estimation, in order to derive referee rulings.

# Layout

## Whistle detection

in the `whistle_detection` folder, open `whistle_detection.ipynb` and run the notebook. 
The dataset is already in the directory, but can also be downloaded from the original source.

[Whistle Dataset](https://sibylle.informatik.uni-bremen.de/public/datasets/whistle-2017) 

## Pose Estimation

in the `pose_estimation` folder, open `pose_estimation_basic.ipynb` or `pose_estimation_advanced.ipynb` and run the notebook. 
The dataset needs to be downloaded seperately (too large for github). Put the dataset in the same directory as the notebooks.
